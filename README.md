# A simple HTTP-server with client
This is an implementation of the server-client solution for getting current time in Minsk and Moscow.

In order to execute the project you need to enable **server** first with `go build` or `go run` commands (the same for
the **client**) of [server](./server/server.go) ([client](./client/client.go)).

1. The server listens on port :9093 
2. Getting time is simple: run the client
